<p> In assignment 2, I have implemented several different techniques that go beyond basic requirements of this assignment:</p>
<ol> 
     <li> <p>The first technique is a clock counting down for limiting time. Using another function(countdown), I could have a timer that limit the time of user to 10 minutes.
	 <a href="quiz.php">Here is where you could find it and see.</a> </p>
	 <p> I have learned this feature from this website: <a href="https://gist.github.com/adhithyan15/4350689"> https://gist.github.com/adhithyan15/4350689</a></p>
	 <p> Also, here is code parts that I have used for this feature:</p>
	 <figure>
     <img src="images/counter.png" alt="Countdown timer" width="1031" height="500">

      </figure></li>
	  
	  <li> <p> The second technique in my case is using querySelector(). By using this, the error message could become red when error happened and we could use for 
	  validating checkbox.<a href="quiz.php"> Here is where you could find it.</a></p>
	  <p> I find out about this technique on these websites: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_queryselector.asp"> 
	  https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_queryselector.asp</a> and <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/how-to-check-checkbox-checked/">
	  https://flaviocopes.com/how-to-check-checkbox-checked/</a></p>
	  <p> Here is the code parts for the feature: </p>
	  <figure>
	  <img src="images/querySelector.png" alt="QuerySelector" width="893" height="227">

      </figure></li>
	  
</ol>
<p> I hope that you find out these new features on my webpage enjoyable and interesting.</p>
